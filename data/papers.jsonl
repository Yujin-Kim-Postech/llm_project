This paper investigates how insurers' robustness preferences shape competitive equilibrium in a dynamic insurance market.Insurers optimize their underwriting and liquidity management strategies to maximize shareholder value, leading to equilibrium outcomes that can be analytically derived and numerically solved. Compared to a bench- mark without model uncertainty, robust insurance pric-ing results in significantly higher premiums and equity valuations. Notably, our model yields three novel in- sights: (1) The minimum, maximum, and admissible range of aggregate capacity all expand, indicating that insurers' liquidity management becomes more conserva-tive. (2) The expected length of the underwriting cycle increases substantially, far exceeding the range commonly reported in earlier empirical studies. (3) While the capacity process remains ergodic in the long run, the stationary density becomes more concentrated in low‐capacity states, implying that liquidity ‐constrained insurers require longer to recover. Together, these find-ings provide a potential explanation for recent skepticism regarding the empirical evidence of underwriting cycles, suggesting that such cycles may indeed exist but are considerably longer than previously assumed.

However, following the 2017 event, affected insurers did not significantly increase their capital ratios relative to the pre ‐event period. Further analysis reveals that this result is pri-marily driven by Florida ‐focused insurers, which have less diversified operations and lower AM Best ratings, reflecting higher insolvency risk.
